## Abstract
This project develops an LSTM (long short-term memory) autoencoder model to detect anomalous behavior in the Dogecoin cryptocurrency market using OHLC (open, high, low, close) and volume-related features. The model captures complex, temporal relationships between multiple variables, offering a more nuanced detection of market anomalies compared to traditional volume-based methods. Principal component analysis revealed that market anomalies in 2021 were influenced by a broad set of factors, while those in 2024 were primarily driven by shifts in trading volume. The LSTM autoencoder provides a robust framework for anomaly detection and can serve as the foundation for future market alert systems or high-frequency trading algorithms, with potential applications to other financial assets.
